Hi, I'm Vincent Yanzee J. Tan.

Started [this project][debug-stick] at 13 because Bedrock didn’t have a debug
stick. It somehow grew to hundreds of thousands of downloads, grateful for
everyone who supported it.

I’ll keep maintaining it until Mojang adds an official one. After that, it
might be time for me to move on.

Thanks!
